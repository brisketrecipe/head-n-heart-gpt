Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?
• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?
• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and weaknesses.

Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet. Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.

Growth thrives in conducive surroundings.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Environment” then come back to your worksheet.
Growth is signiﬁcantly diminished in unhealthy environments. In the video, John quotes the advice of his mentor and friend, Elmer Towns, who told John to spend time with great people, read great books, visit great places, attend great events, and nourish yourself. Sounds simple, but we often complicate matters.
Here’s the truth: If we don’t invest in ourselves ﬁrst, no one else is going to. We don’t want to be cranky and bitter. We want to be the leader who brings life to the team, who comes with a healthy perspective, fresh eyes, a sense of wonder and amazement at what the world has to oﬀer. That means making time to create a growth environment that will help us be the best we can be.

Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.

Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, areas of choice are more like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, confidence, faith, and trust. Areas of skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, fitness, diet, professional development, etc.

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?
• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?
• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and weaknesses.

Growth requires planning, strategy, and focused eﬀort. Growth is intentional. As a leader, you must ﬁrst invest in yourself because you can’t give what you don’t have.

Great leaders embrace a journey mentality. They understand that the process is the product—that what you put into something shows up in the result. We have to lean out of our comfort zone and lean into the challenges that will stretch us towards the person and lead we want to become. Day 17-20 Questions for Group Discussion: Where is one place you’ve developed a ﬁnish line mentality with your team? Why do you think that is, and what can you do to inspire fresh growth?

Let’s get started. Over the next 30 days, we’re going to develop our growth plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, Ambition, Advancement. These are better expressed in three questions: • Where am I? • Where am I going?• How will I get there?

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 6The Law of Curiosity: Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet. Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 10The Law of the Environment:
Growth thrives in conducive surroundings.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Environment” then come back to your worksheet.
Growth is signiﬁcantly diminished in unhealthy environments. In the video, John quotes the advice of his mentor and friend, Elmer Towns, who told John to spend time with great people, read great books, visit great places, attend great events, and nourish yourself. Sounds simple, but we often complicate matters.
Here’s the truth: If we don’t invest in ourselves ﬁrst, no one else is going to. We don’t want to be cranky and bitter. We want to be the leader who brings life to the team, who comes with a healthy perspective, fresh eyes, a sense of wonder and amazement at what the world has to oﬀer. That means making time to create a growth environment that will help us be the best we can be.

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 7The Law of the Modeling:
It’s hard to improve when you have no one else but yourself to follow.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.

I need you to analyze the provided context and extract the most relevant material for developing a lesson plan for the Wolff Center for Entrepreneurship (WCE) at the University of Houston's C. T. Bauer College of Business.

The WCE is guided by a philosophy centered on empowering students to understand their values, articulate their dreams, and achieve tangible outcomes. The program emphasizes both academic rigor and real-world application, preparing students to assume leadership roles in business by teaching them how to develop and implement their own ventures. WCE fosters personal and professional growth through mentorship, experiential learning, and a commitment to integrity and innovation.

Our program focuses on four core value categories, each with four specific behavioral competencies:

1. ACTION
   - Results
   - Execution
   - Fearless Presenter
   - Seize Opportunities

2. RELATIONSHIPS
   - Connection
   - Leadership
   - Collaboration
   - Awareness

3. DISCIPLINE
   - Planning
   - Constructive Thinking
   - Organize
   - Control

4. PURPOSE
   - Authenticity
   - CEO Perspective
   - Vision
   - Growth Mindset

For the behavioral competency: We want to develop a lesson plan on 'Seize Opportunities' for our WCE students. Please extract the relevant material and provide suggestions that align with this behavioral competency under the ACTION core value.

Please extract 8-10 relevant sections from the context, provide precise references for each, and suggest how to incorporate them into our entrepreneurship-focused lesson plan. Each suggestion should specifically reinforce the behavioral competency while aligning with WCE's overall philosophy. Conclude with an overall approach for teaching this competency.

In the reference output, please explicitly mention the filename from the content. It is listed in the metadata at the top of each file as "filename".

The additional user and assistant prompts are only for reference. Do not use them in your response. Please only use use the context provided. Do not assume the lesson plan the user is asking for, allow them to tell you.

      "content": "Effective communication is not merely about slide design or voice projection—it's about conveying conviction in your venture's value proposition.

      "teaching_suggestion": "Structure a progressive pitching exercise where students present the same concept three times with increasing stakes: first to a peer, then to a small group, and finally to a panel of visiting entrepreneurs. Provide specific feedback on how their conviction comes through in each iteration."

      "teaching_suggestion": "Teach specific pre-presentation routines that embrace nervous energy, including power posing, controlled breathing, and positive visualization. Have students develop personalized 5-minute pre-presentation rituals they can implement before important pitches."

      "teaching_suggestion": "Conduct a workshop where students bring their venture's most complex dataset and develop three different visualization approaches, then test which creates the fastest understanding with audience members."
    }
  ],
  "lesson_approach": "To develop 'Fearless Presenter' competency in WCE students, I recommend an immersive approach that integrates technical presentation skills with emotional resilience building. The lesson should begin by addressing the psychological barriers many entrepreneurs face when presenting their ventures, framing fear as a natural response that can be channeled productively. I suggest implementing a 'presentation laboratory' format where students regularly present in increasingly challenging scenarios—from informal peer sessions to formal investor panels with real-world entrepreneurs. Throughout this progression, focus on three pillars: (1) authentic message development that aligns with the student's personal values, (2) strategic presentation design that emphasizes story over slides, and (3) embodied communication techniques that build physical confidence. The most effective approach would culminate in a high-stakes presentation opportunity where students must respond to unexpected challenges or questions, reinforcing WCE's action-oriented philosophy. Consider recording presentations at various stages of development so students can witness their own growth, reinforcing the Growth Mindset competency from the Purpose category while building their confidence as Fearless Presenters."

    }
  ],
  "lesson_approach": "To develop the 'CEO Perspective' competency under the PURPOSE core value, I recommend a lesson approach that balances conceptual understanding with experiential learning. Begin with a session exploring the distinction between management (doing things right) and leadership (doing the right things), using case studies that illustrate how CEO Perspective manifests in entrepreneurial decision-making. The heart of the lesson should utilize a comprehensive business simulation where students rotate through the CEO role, facing escalating challenges that require them to balance competing priorities, make decisions with incomplete information, and communicate their reasoning to various stakeholders. Critical to this approach is structured reflection after each simulation round, where students articulate how their decisions align with both immediate business needs and longer-term vision. Throughout the lesson, deliberately connect CEO Perspective to the other PURPOSE competencies, particularly Vision and Authenticity, showing how effective CEOs maintain alignment between personal values, company mission, and strategic decisions. Consider partnering with the WCE mentorship network to arrange shadow opportunities where students observe real CEOs navigating complex decisions, followed by debrief conversations about the thought processes witnessed. The assessment should evaluate students not on the specific decisions made, but on their ability to articulate comprehensive reasoning that demonstrates holistic understanding of their venture's ecosystem."

Context:
Your plan is going to be personaliz ed and it’s going to involve one ar ea of choice and one area of skill. ... Over the next 30 days, we’re going  to develop our growth plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, Ambition, Advancement.

The Law of Curiosity: Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. ... Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. ... Curiosity is the precursor to action.

My team will read the following book to grow in our area of choice:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
My team will read the following book to grow in our area of skill:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, areas of choice are more like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, confidence, faith, and trust. Areas of skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, fitness, diet, professional development, etc.

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?
• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?
• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and weaknesses.

The Law of Awareness: Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself. ... It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and weaknesses.

Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. ... Your friend, 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 3The Law of Intentionality: Watch and take notes on the video ... Growth requires planning, strategy, and focused eﬀort. Growth is intentional. As a leader, you must ﬁrst invest in yourself because you can’t give what you don’t have.

Great leaders embrace a journey mentality. They understand that the process is the product—that what you put into something shows up in the result. We have to lean out of our comfort zone and lean into the challenges that will stretch us towards the person and lead we want to become. Day 17-20 Questions for Group Discussion: Where is one place you’ve developed a ﬁnish line mentality with your team? Why do you think that is, and what can you do to inspire fresh growth?

Your plan is going to be personalized and it’s going to involve one area of choice and one area of skill. Just follow along with this PDF worksheet and you’ll end these 30 days with your own personalized growth plan, as you rely on my teaching from The 15 Laws of Growth to help spur your thinking. Let’s get started. Over the next 30 days, we’re going to develop our growth plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, Ambition, Advancement. These are better expressed in three questions: • Where am I? • Where am I going?• How will I get there?

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 6The Law of Curiosity: Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet. Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 10The Law of the Environment:
Growth thrives in conducive surroundings.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Environment” then come back to your worksheet.
Growth is signiﬁcantly diminished in unhealthy environments. In the video, John quotes the advice of his mentor and friend, Elmer Towns, who told John to spend time with great people, read great books, visit great places, attend great events, and nourish yourself. Sounds simple, but we often complicate matters.
Here’s the truth: If we don’t invest in ourselves ﬁrst, no one else is going to. We don’t want to be cranky and bitter. We want to be the leader who brings life to the team, who comes with a healthy perspective, fresh eyes, a sense of wonder and amazement at what the world has to oﬀer. That means making time to create a growth environment that will help us be the best we can be.

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 7The Law of the Modeling:
It’s hard to improve when you have no one else but yourself to follow.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 12
My area of choice where I will grow is:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
My area of skill where I will grow is:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A person I will ask to mentor/coach me in my growth is:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 9The Law of the Consistency:
Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Consistency” then come back to your worksheet.

Day 14-16
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where in your life do you want to develop moral authority? Why?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
If you could be known for one thing, what would you want it to be? What would it
take to get that level of respect? What value could you pass on as a mentor? Do you
know anyone who might want to learn from you? Who on your team has moral
authority with you? What makes you trust them in this way?

Questions for Group Discussion: In your opinion, why do people get change and growth confused? Of the choices you make with your team, how many are made in the moment and how many are based on strategy?

Day 21-23
Questions for Group Discussion:
In what areas does your team struggle the most with consistency or do best with being consistent? As a leader, why do you think they struggle in one area and succeed in the other?

Take some time to reflect and write out your answers. Then, if you’re feeling bold and really want to ensure accountability, post it on social media or text your thoughts to a friend or mentor. Keep in mind, a shared commitment becomes a strong commitment. Once you’ve taken that first step, it’s time to dive in. Get ready, get set, grow. 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 1Developing Your 30-Day Growth Plan
