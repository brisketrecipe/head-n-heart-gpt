Content: Welcome to John C. Maxwell’s 30-Day  Growth Plan! We’re glad you’re he re, and we’re looking 
forward to walking beside you o n your leadership journey. 
You downloaded this guide because y ou know something a lot of peo ple with great potential 
miss, every leader needs to embrac e per sonal growth in order to creat e growth in their 
business, team, community, or wit h an ything outside of themsel eves .
Everything you want out of life  will come through your willingn ess to grow. That’s because  you 
can’t give what you don’t have , and you can’t lead where you don’t  go.
Each section will be an exploratio n of a diﬀerent facet of growth,  complete with deep dives  into 
pressing topics, reﬂection time, a nd growth-oriented work.
The next 30 days will transform  your  approach to your daily lif e if you take this plan ser iously. 
Be intentional and you’ll see inc redible results.
This guide is designed for you  to take t his personal growth jo urney alone OR with a friend or 
group. It’s up to you. There are reﬂect ion and discussion guides  throughout for both personal 
and group study.
Let’s dive right in with two key two ques tions you need to consider:
• What keeps you from being authentic with others?
• What barriers to authenticity (beliefs, fears, experiences, etc.) do you struggle against?
Answering these questions lets you know if you’re being honest enough with yourself to take 
this journey. It also tells you where your growth is going to be most important and most challenging through this process.
Take some time to reﬂect and write out your answers. Then, if you’re feeling bold and really 
want to ensure accountability, post it on social media or text your thoughts to a friend or mentor. Keep in mind, a shared commitment becomes a strong commitment.
Once you’ve taken that ﬁrst step, it’s time to dive in. Get ready, get set, grow.

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 7The Law of the Modeling:
It’s hard to improve when you have no one else but yourself to follow.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.
Chances are you might start your wish list of mentoring qualities with things like talent, success, 
achievement, reputation. While those are good things to have in a mentor, it’s far better to have moral authority. That means being a person of character, conviction, and integrity—and sustaining that life over time. You don’t have the be the world’s greatest all-around human in order to have moral authority. You can distinguish yourself in any number of areas while still growing yourself in others.Day 14-16
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where in your life do you want to develop moral authority? Why?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
If you could be known for one thing, what would you want it to be? What would it 
take to get that level of respect? What value could you pass on as a mentor? Do you 
know anyone who might want to learn from you? Who on your team has moral 
authority with you? What makes you trust them in this way?

of skill. Just follow along with this PDF 
worksheet and you’ll end these 30 days with 
your own personalized growth plan, as you rely 
on my teaching from The 15 Laws of Growth to 
help spur your thinking. Let’s get started.Over the next 30 days, we’re going  to develop our growth 
plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, 
Ambition, 
Advancement.
These are better expressed in three questions:
• Where am I?
• Where am I going?• How will I get there?
PASSION
Early in my career, I met a mento r who provided me with a personal growth kit—an all-in-
one guide to ﬁve areas of my life. I had never invested in myself in this way, and I soon 
realized that growth is the only guarantee that tomorrow would be better than today. 
So, it’s best to have a plan for strategic growth.
Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, a reas of choice are more 
like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, conﬁdence,  faith, and trust. Areas of 
skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, ﬁtness, diet, 
professional development, etc.

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this 
can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and 
weaknesses.
BONUS:
John’s podcast on identifying leadership blind spots oﬀers bonus insights into seeing yourself 
realistically. Download the PDF notes and listen here: https://johnmaxwellleadershippodcast.com/episodes/leadership-blind-spots
No one can produce great things who is not thoroughly sincere in dealing with him- or herself.”Day 4-6
Questions for Group Discussion:
What strengths and weaknesses did you discover in yourself?
In thinking of your team’s strengths and weaknesses, what do you think your team would write?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What strengths and weaknesses in yourself can you recognize? What are your team’s strengths 
and weaknesses?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 6The Law of Curiosity:
Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. 
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet.
Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. 
Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. 
Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your 
history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.
BONUS:
Writer and scientist Carol S. Dweck in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success writes that 
ﬁxed mindsets believe a person’s qualities are set traits and not capable of being changed. Growth mindsets believe learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. Explore which mindset you embrace and think through your culture, upbringing, and experiences brought you to that mindset.Day 11-13
Questions for Group Discussion:
Which kind of person are you: the one who asks Why or the one who asks Why Not? Give 
context to your answer
 What kinds of things do you do to fuel your curiosity or feed your interests?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What are you curious about? Have you done much to investigate those subjects?
Why or why not? Who on your team is naturally curious? How can you tell? What can you 
learn from them?

Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of the Mirror” then co me back to your worksheet.
How do you see yourself? John often ta lks about our lives as  a story—we’re living out a st ory for others 
to read. If you don’t see yourself as  the hero of your own st ory, you  don’t have a high-enough 
self-image. You determine what  cou rse your life will take. Yo u decide what dreams you will ch ase, wh at 
impact you will make, and what  legacy you will leave. 
The Law of Mirror is the perfect time a ccept and embrace the tr uth that you are worthy of 
investment, and that your leader ship lives or dies on the inve stment s you make in yourself. In  the 
video, John said, “You have to bet on yo urself ﬁrst.” This is where we all must decide whether we’re 
willing to make that bet. Are y ou all-in?Day 7-10
Questions for Group Discussion:
How is your self-image on a scale of 1-10?
How is your self-investment on a scale of 1-10?
What’s the diﬀerence between your self-image and your self-investment?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What changes do you need to make to become the hero of your own story? What 
would the outcome be for your team? When was the last time you bet big on yourself 
and what were the results?

The next 30 days will transform  your  approach to your daily lif e if you take this plan ser iously. 
Be intentional and you’ll see inc redible results.
This guide is designed for you  to take t his personal growth jo urney alone OR with a friend or 
group. It’s up to you. There are reﬂect ion and discussion guides  throughout for both personal 
and group study.
Let’s dive right in with two key two ques tions you need to consider:
• What keeps you from being authentic with others?
• What barriers to authenticity (beliefs, fears, experiences, etc.) do you struggle against?
Answering these questions lets you know if you’re being honest enough with yourself to take 
this journey. It also tells you where your growth is going to be most important and most challenging through this process.
Take some time to reﬂect and write out your answers. Then, if you’re feeling bold and really 
want to ensure accountability, post it on social media or text your thoughts to a friend or mentor. Keep in mind, a shared commitment becomes a strong commitment.
Once you’ve taken that ﬁrst step, it’s time to dive in. Get ready, get set, grow.

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 7The Law of the Modeling:
It’s hard to improve when you have no one else but yourself to follow.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.
Chances are you might start your wish list of mentoring qualities with things like talent, success, 
achievement, reputation. While those are good things to have in a mentor, it’s far better to have moral authority. That means being a person of character, conviction, and integrity—and sustaining that life over time. You don’t have the be the world’s greatest all-around human in order to have moral authority. You can distinguish yourself in any number of areas while still growing yourself in others.Day 14-16
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where in your life do you want to develop moral authority? Why?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
If you could be known for one thing, what would you want it to be? What would it 
take to get that level of respect? What value could you pass on as a mentor? Do you 
know anyone who might want to learn from you? Who on your team has moral 
authority with you? What makes you trust them in this way?

Content: Your plan is going to be personaliz ed and it’s 
going to involve one ar
ea of choice and one area 
of skill. Just follow along with this PDF 
worksheet and you’ll end these 30 days with 
your own personalized growth plan, as you rely 
on my teaching from The 15 Laws of Growth to 
help spur your thinking. Let’s get started.Over the next 30 days, we’re going  to develop our growth 
plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, 
Ambition, 
Advancement.
These are better expressed in three questions:
• Where am I?
• Where am I going?• How will I get there?
PASSION
Early in my career, I met a mento r who provided me with a personal growth kit—an all-in-
one guide to ﬁve areas of my life. I had never invested in myself in this way, and I soon 
realized that growth is the only guarantee that tomorrow would be better than today. 
So, it’s best to have a plan for strategic growth.
Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, a reas of choice are more 
like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, conﬁdence,  faith, and trust. Areas of 
skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, ﬁtness, diet, 
professional development, etc.
Your friend,

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this 
can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and 
weaknesses.
BONUS:

realistically. Download the PDF notes and listen here: https://johnmaxwellleadershippodcast.com/episodes/leadership-blind-spots
No one can produce great things who is not thoroughly sincere in dealing with him- or herself.”Day 4-6
Questions for Group Discussion:
What strengths and weaknesses did you discover in yourself?
In thinking of your team’s strengths and weaknesses, what do you think your team would write?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What strengths and weaknesses in yourself can you recognize? What are your team’s strengths 
and weaknesses?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 6The Law of Curiosity:
Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. 
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet.
Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. 
Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. 
Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your 
history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.
BONUS:
Writer and scientist Carol S. Dweck in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success writes that 
ﬁxed mindsets believe a person’s qualities are set traits and not capable of being changed. Growth mindsets believe learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. Explore which mindset you embrace and think through your culture, upbringing, and experiences brought you to that mindset.Day 11-13
Questions for Group Discussion:
Which kind of person are you: the one who asks Why or the one who asks Why Not? Give 
context to your answer
 What kinds of things do you do to fuel your curiosity or feed your interests?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What are you curious about? Have you done much to investigate those subjects?
Why or why not? Who on your team is naturally curious? How can you tell? What can you 
learn from them?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 5The Law of the Mirror:
How we see ourselves determines how we invest in ourselves.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of the Mirror” then co me back to your worksheet.
How do you see yourself? John often ta lks about our lives as  a story—we’re living out a st ory for others 
to read. If you don’t see yourself as  the hero of your own st ory, you  don’t have a high-enough 
self-image. You determine what  cou rse your life will take. Yo u decide what dreams you will ch ase, wh at 
impact you will make, and what  legacy you will leave. 
The Law of Mirror is the perfect time a ccept and embrace the tr uth that you are worthy of 
investment, and that your leader ship lives or dies on the inve stment s you make in yourself. In  the 
video, John said, “You have to bet on yo urself ﬁrst.” This is where we all must decide whether we’re 
willing to make that bet. Are y ou all-in?Day 7-10
Questions for Group Discussion:
How is your self-image on a scale of 1-10?
How is your self-investment on a scale of 1-10?
What’s the diﬀerence between your self-image and your self-investment?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What changes do you need to make to become the hero of your own story? What 
would the outcome be for your team? When was the last time you bet big on yourself 
and what were the results?

The lesson should begin by addressing the psychological barriers many entrepreneurs face when presenting their ventures, framing fear as a natural response that can be channeled productively. I suggest implementing a 'presentation laboratory' format where students regularly present in increasingly challenging scenarios—from informal peer sessions to formal investor panels with real-world entrepreneurs. Throughout this progression, focus on three pillars: (1) authentic message development that aligns with the student's personal values, (2) strategic presentation design that emphasizes story over slides, and (3) embodied communication techniques that build physical confidence. The most effective approach would culminate in a high-stakes presentation opportunity where students must respond to unexpected challenges or questions, reinforcing WCE's action-oriented philosophy. Consider recording presentations at various stages of development so students can witness their own growth, reinforcing the Growth Mindset competency from the Purpose category while building their confidence as Fearless Presenters."

The heart of the lesson should utilize a comprehensive business simulation where students rotate through the CEO role, facing escalating challenges that require them to balance competing priorities, make decisions with incomplete information, and communicate their reasoning to various stakeholders. Critical to this approach is structured reflection after each simulation round, where students articulate how their decisions align with both immediate business needs and longer-term vision. Throughout the lesson, deliberately connect CEO Perspective to the other PURPOSE competencies, particularly Vision and Authenticity, showing how effective CEOs maintain alignment between personal values, company mission, and strategic decisions. Consider partnering with the WCE mentorship network to arrange shadow opportunities where students observe real CEOs navigating complex decisions, followed by debrief conversations about the thought processes witnessed. The assessment should evaluate students not on the specific decisions made, but on their ability to articulate comprehensive reasoning that demonstrates holistic understanding of their venture's ecosystem."

Content: Your plan is going to be personaliz ed and it’s 
going to involve one ar
ea of choice and one area 
of skill. Just follow along with this PDF 
worksheet and you’ll end these 30 days with 
your own personalized growth plan, as you rely 
on my teaching from The 15 Laws of Growth to 
help spur your thinking. Let’s get started.Over the next 30 days, we’re going  to develop our growth 
plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, 
Ambition, 
Advancement.
These are better expressed in three questions:
• Where am I?
• Where am I going?• How will I get there?
PASSION
Early in my career, I met a mento r who provided me with a personal growth kit—an all-in-
one guide to ﬁve areas of my life. I had never invested in myself in this way, and I soon 
realized that growth is the only guarantee that tomorrow would be better than today. 
So, it’s best to have a plan for strategic growth.
Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, a reas of choice are more 
like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, conﬁdence,  faith, and trust. Areas of

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this 
can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and 
weaknesses.
BONUS:
John’s podcast on identifying leadership blind spots oﬀers bonus insights into seeing yourself 
realistically. Download the PDF notes and listen here: https://johnmaxwellleadershippodcast.com/episodes/leadership-blind-spots

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 6The Law of Curiosity:
Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. 
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet.
Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. 
Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. 
Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your 
history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.
BONUS:
Writer and scientist Carol S. Dweck in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success writes that 
ﬁxed mindsets believe a person’s qualities are set traits and not capable of being changed. Growth mindsets believe learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. Explore which mindset you embrace and think through your culture, upbringing, and experiences brought you to that mindset.Day 11-13
Questions for Group Discussion:
Which kind of person are you: the one who asks Why or the one who asks Why Not? Give 
context to your answer
 What kinds of things do you do to fuel your curiosity or feed your interests?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What are you curious about? Have you done much to investigate those subjects?
Why or why not? Who on your team is naturally curious? How can you tell? What can you 
learn from them?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 5The Law of the Mirror:
How we see ourselves determines how we invest in ourselves.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of the Mirror” then co me back to your worksheet.
How do you see yourself? John often ta lks about our lives as  a story—we’re living out a st ory for others 
to read. If you don’t see yourself as  the hero of your own st ory, you  don’t have a high-enough 
self-image. You determine what  cou rse your life will take. Yo u decide what dreams you will ch ase, wh at 
impact you will make, and what  legacy you will leave. 
The Law of Mirror is the perfect time a ccept and embrace the tr uth that you are worthy of 
investment, and that your leader ship lives or dies on the inve stment s you make in yourself. In  the 
video, John said, “You have to bet on yo urself ﬁrst.” This is where we all must decide whether we’re 
willing to make that bet. Are y ou all-in?Day 7-10
Questions for Group Discussion:
How is your self-image on a scale of 1-10?
How is your self-investment on a scale of 1-10?
What’s the diﬀerence between your self-image and your self-investment?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What changes do you need to make to become the hero of your own story? What 
would the outcome be for your team? When was the last time you bet big on yourself 
and what were the results?
