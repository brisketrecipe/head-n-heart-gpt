Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, areas of choice are more like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, confidence, faith, and trust. Areas of skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, fitness, diet, professional development, etc.

30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?
• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?
• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and weaknesses.

I need you to analyze the provided context and extract the most relevant material for developing a lesson plan for the Wolff Center for Entrepreneurship (WCE) at the University of Houston's C. T. Bauer College of Business.

The WCE is guided by a philosophy centered on empowering students to understand their values, articulate their dreams, and achieve tangible outcomes. The program emphasizes both academic rigor and real-world application, preparing students to assume leadership roles in business by teaching them how to develop and implement their own ventures. WCE fosters personal and professional growth through mentorship, experiential learning, and a commitment to integrity and innovation.

Our program focuses on four core value categories, each with four specific behavioral competencies:

1. ACTION
   - Results
   - Execution
   - Fearless Presenter
   - Seize Opportunities

2. RELATIONSHIPS
   - Connection
   - Leadership
   - Collaboration
   - Awareness

3. DISCIPLINE
   - Planning
   - Constructive Thinking
   - Organize
   - Control

4. PURPOSE
   - Authenticity
   - CEO Perspective
   - Vision
   - Growth Mindset

For the behavioral competency: We want to develop a lesson plan on 'Seize Opportunities' for our WCE students. Please extract the relevant material and provide suggestions that align with this behavioral competency under the ACTION core value.

Please extract 8-10 relevant sections from the context, provide precise references for each, and suggest how to incorporate them into our entrepreneurship-focused lesson plan. Each suggestion should specifically reinforce the behavioral competency while aligning with WCE's overall philosophy. Conclude with an overall approach for teaching this competency.

In the reference output, please explicitly mention the filename from the content. It is listed in the metadata at the top of each file as "filename".

The additional user and assistant prompts are only for reference. Do not use them in your response. Please only use use the context provided. Do not assume the lesson plan the user is asking for, allow them to tell you.

    }
  ],
  "lesson_approach": "To develop 'Fearless Presenter' competency in WCE students, I recommend an immersive approach that integrates technical presentation skills with emotional resilience building. The lesson should begin by addressing the psychological barriers many entrepreneurs face when presenting their ventures, framing fear as a natural response that can be channeled productively. I suggest implementing a 'presentation laboratory' format where students regularly present in increasingly challenging scenarios—from informal peer sessions to formal investor panels with real-world entrepreneurs. Throughout this progression, focus on three pillars: (1) authentic message development that aligns with the student's personal values, (2) strategic presentation design that emphasizes story over slides, and (3) embodied communication techniques that build physical confidence. The most effective approach would culminate in a high-stakes presentation opportunity where students must respond to unexpected challenges or questions, reinforcing WCE's action-oriented philosophy. Consider recording presentations at various stages of development so students can witness their own growth, reinforcing the Growth Mindset competency from the Purpose category while building their confidence as Fearless Presenters."

  "lesson_approach": "To develop the 'CEO Perspective' competency under the PURPOSE core value, I recommend a lesson approach that balances conceptual understanding with experiential learning. Begin with a session exploring the distinction between management (doing things right) and leadership (doing the right things), using case studies that illustrate how CEO Perspective manifests in entrepreneurial decision-making. The heart of the lesson should utilize a comprehensive business simulation where students rotate through the CEO role, facing escalating challenges that require them to balance competing priorities, make decisions with incomplete information, and communicate their reasoning to various stakeholders. Critical to this approach is structured reflection after each simulation round, where students articulate how their decisions align with both immediate business needs and longer-term vision. Throughout the lesson, deliberately connect CEO Perspective to the other PURPOSE competencies, particularly Vision and Authenticity, showing how effective CEOs maintain alignment between personal values, company mission, and strategic decisions. Consider partnering with the WCE mentorship network to arrange shadow opportunities where students observe real CEOs navigating complex decisions, followed by debrief conversations about the thought processes witnessed. The assessment should evaluate students not on the specific decisions made, but on their ability to articulate comprehensive reasoning that demonstrates holistic understanding of their venture's ecosystem."
