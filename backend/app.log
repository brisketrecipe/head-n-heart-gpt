It’s hard to improve when you have no one else but yourself to follow.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.
Chances are you might start your wish list of mentoring qualities with things like talent, success, 
achievement, reputation. While those are good things to have in a mentor, it’s far better to have moral authority. That means being a person of character, conviction, and integrity—and sustaining that life over time. You don’t have the be the world’s greatest all-around human in order to have moral authority. You can distinguish yourself in any number of areas while still growing yourself in others.Day 14-16
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where in your life do you want to develop moral authority? Why?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
If you could be known for one thing, what would you want it to be? What would it 
take to get that level of respect? What value could you pass on as a mentor? Do you 
know anyone who might want to learn from you? Who on your team has moral 
authority with you? What makes you trust them in this way?

You downloaded this guide because y ou know something a lot of peo ple with great potential 
miss, every leader needs to embrac e per sonal growth in order to creat e growth in their 
business, team, community, or wit h an ything outside of themsel eves .
Everything you want out of life  will come through your willingn ess to grow. That’s because  you 
can’t give what you don’t have , and you can’t lead where you don’t  go.
Each section will be an exploratio n of a diﬀerent facet of growth,  complete with deep dives  into 
pressing topics, reﬂection time, a nd growth-oriented work.
The next 30 days will transform  your  approach to your daily lif e if you take this plan ser iously. 
Be intentional and you’ll see inc redible results.
This guide is designed for you  to take t his personal growth jo urney alone OR with a friend or 
group. It’s up to you. There are reﬂect ion and discussion guides  throughout for both personal 
and group study.
Let’s dive right in with two key two ques tions you need to consider:
• What keeps you from being authentic with others?
• What barriers to authenticity (beliefs, fears, experiences, etc.) do you struggle against?
Answering these questions lets you know if you’re being honest enough with yourself to take 
this journey. It also tells you where your growth is going to be most important and most challenging through this process.
Take some time to reﬂect and write out your answers. Then, if you’re feeling bold and really 
want to ensure accountability, post it on social media or text your thoughts to a friend or mentor. Keep in mind, a shared commitment becomes a strong commitment.
Once you’ve taken that ﬁrst step, it’s time to dive in. Get ready, get set, grow.

help spur your thinking. Let’s get started.Over the next 30 days, we’re going  to develop our growth 
plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, 
Ambition, 
Advancement.
These are better expressed in three questions:
• Where am I?
• Where am I going?• How will I get there?
PASSION
Early in my career, I met a mento r who provided me with a personal growth kit—an all-in-
one guide to ﬁve areas of my life. I had never invested in myself in this way, and I soon 
realized that growth is the only guarantee that tomorrow would be better than today. 
So, it’s best to have a plan for strategic growth.
Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, a reas of choice are more 
like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, conﬁdence,  faith, and trust. Areas of 
skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, ﬁtness, diet, 
professional development, etc.

Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this 
can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and 
weaknesses.

Growth thrives in conducive surroundings.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Environment” then come back to your worksheet.
Growth is signiﬁcantly diminished in unhealthy environments. In the video, John quotes the advice of his 
mentor and friend, Elmer Towns, who told John to spend time with great people, read great books, visit great places, attend great events, and nourish yourself. Sounds simple, but we often complicate matters. 
Here’s the truth: If we don’t invest in ourselves ﬁrst, no one else is going to. We don’t want to be cranky 
and bitter. We want to be the leader who brings life to the team, who comes with a healthy perspective, fresh eyes, a sense of wonder and amazement at what the world has to oﬀer. That means making time to create a growth environment that will help us be the best we can be.Day 24-26

Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. 
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet.
Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. 
Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. 
Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your 
history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.
BONUS:
Writer and scientist Carol S. Dweck in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success writes that 
ﬁxed mindsets believe a person’s qualities are set traits and not capable of being changed. Growth mindsets believe learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. Explore which mindset you embrace and think through your culture, upbringing, and experiences brought you to that mindset.Day 11-13

Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Intentionality” then come back to your worksheet.
As John said in the video, growth is not automatic. 
Nature suggests that growth just happens. 
But that’s not the truth. 
Change is automatic. 
Change happens whether you like it or not, but growth is guided change. 
Growth requires planning, strategy, and focused eﬀort. Growth is intentional. As a leader, you must ﬁrst 
invest in yourself because you can’t give what you don’t have.
Growth is the only 
guarantee that 
tomorrow is going 
to get better.”Day 1-3

Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Consistency” then come back to your worksheet.
Consistency sounds boring. But as John talked about in the Law of Expansion, routine only becomes 
boring when it’s measured against a ﬁnish line. When we understand that daily habits compound into excellence, it reframes our way of thinking. 
One of John’s most helpful strategies in this area is the Rule of 5. For example, John doesn’t crank out 
more than 100 books by just writing when he feels like it. Every day he does ﬁve things to stay consistent in his writing: reads, thinks, writes, ﬁles, and asks questions. Consistency is achieved when we can develop the necessary habits that will point us towards success, and habits are developed best when they are strategic and simple. A daily Rule of 5 for yourself and your team are essential for growth.Day 21-23

To maximize growth, develop strategies.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Design” then come back to your worksheet.
We’ve ﬁnally arrived at the Law of Design, which is all about the strategies we develop to help us achieve 
our personal growth. The ﬁnal step in developing your personal growth plan will be ﬁlling out the two Growth Plan Outlines that we’ve provided—one for you and one if you’re doing this exercise with a team.
But the real work begins after today. You have to execute on the plan you’ve developed, otherwise all of 
this work will be for nothing. This is where you have to determine again that you will pay the price to grow.
We’re in this together. As you’re ﬁlling out these sheets, share them with a friend or mentor, 
communicate your observations about your plan, and ask them where they see room to reﬁne it. John says that the key to making any growth plan stick is making it public, and after 30 days, you’ll not only have a solid plan, but a community of support along the way.Day 27-30

Several years ago, Nike released one of their most famous commercials. Simple and sparse, the 
commercial features nothing but a runner, images of famous athletes projected onto buildings as the runner passes by, a haunting piano score, and Nike’s most famous (at the time) tagline: “There is no ﬁnish line.”
As John discussed in the video clip, ﬁnish line mentality takes a short-term view on the process of 
growth; people with a ﬁnish line mentality want to grow right now.
Great leaders embrace a journey mentality. They understand that the process is the product—that what 
you put into something shows up in the result. We have to lean out of our comfort zone and lean into the challenges that will stretch us towards the person and lead we want to become.Day 17-20

1. **Start from a template:** Begin your project by cloning a template from GitHub or another source to provide a solid foundation. (On cursor, Start from Repo, and paste this link to build a nextjs app that is prebuilt with AI features, database and authorization https://github.com/ansh/template-2)

2. **Use agent mode:** Utilize Cursor’s agent mode (not normal mode) to create, edit, and manage files through natural language commands.

3. **Use Perplexity:** Use perplexity to find new designs and api’s from the web. Say that you are creating a nextjs project, and that you want to create ___x___ feature, and to give you instructions AND code examples.

4. **Create new chats in Composer:** Open a new Composer chat for each distinct task. Keep agent chats short.

5. **Run locally, test frequently:** Use built-in servers to run your app locally and test often to catch issues early.

6. **Iterate and refine:** Embrace rapid iteration—don’t worry about perfect designs initially; improve them step by step.

7. **Utilize voice-to-text:** Use tools like *Whispr Flow* for faster input, and just vibe.

8. **Clone and fork wisely:** Use GitHub repos as starting templates to accelerate development, or to find inspiration, then customize them to fit your vision.

9. **Copy errors and paste into Composer agent:** When errors occur, copy error messages from your console and paste them into the Composer agent, and more times than not, it will be fixed. When dealing with errors, over explain the issue if it’s not fixed the first time.

10. **Don’t forget you can restore previous Composer chats:** Save your work frequently so you can revert to an earlier state if needed.

11. **Secure your secrets:** Always store API keys and sensitive data in environment files rather than hard-coding them.

12. **Commit often:** Push your progress to GitHub regularly to track changes and safeguard your work. Cursor can do this for you, just ask the agent.

13. **Deploy early:** Use platforms like Vercel to deploy your app early, to make sure there are no errors on deployment.

14. **Keep a record of the prompts that work best; reuse them often:** Document your most effective prompts to make future development and debugging easier.

15. **Enjoy the process—just vibe:** Embrace the creative journey of vibe coding, experiment, learn, and have fun along the way. just vibe.

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 7The Law of the Modeling:
It’s hard to improve when you have no one else but yourself to follow.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.
Chances are you might start your wish list of mentoring qualities with things like talent, success, 
achievement, reputation. While those are good things to have in a mentor, it’s far better to have moral authority. That means being a person of character, conviction, and integrity—and sustaining that life over time. You don’t have the be the world’s greatest all-around human in order to have moral authority. You can distinguish yourself in any number of areas while still growing yourself in others.Day 14-16
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where in your life do you want to develop moral authority? Why?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
If you could be known for one thing, what would you want it to be? What would it 
take to get that level of respect? What value could you pass on as a mentor? Do you 
know anyone who might want to learn from you? Who on your team has moral 
authority with you? What makes you trust them in this way?

Content: Welcome to John C. Maxwell’s 30-Day  Growth Plan! We’re glad you’re he re, and we’re looking 
forward to walking beside you o n your leadership journey. 
You downloaded this guide because y ou know something a lot of peo ple with great potential 
miss, every leader needs to embrac e per sonal growth in order to creat e growth in their 
business, team, community, or wit h an ything outside of themsel eves .
Everything you want out of life  will come through your willingn ess to grow. That’s because  you 
can’t give what you don’t have , and you can’t lead where you don’t  go.
Each section will be an exploratio n of a diﬀerent facet of growth,  complete with deep dives  into 
pressing topics, reﬂection time, a nd growth-oriented work.
The next 30 days will transform  your  approach to your daily lif e if you take this plan ser iously. 
Be intentional and you’ll see inc redible results.
This guide is designed for you  to take t his personal growth jo urney alone OR with a friend or 
group. It’s up to you. There are reﬂect ion and discussion guides  throughout for both personal 
and group study.
Let’s dive right in with two key two ques tions you need to consider:
• What keeps you from being authentic with others?
• What barriers to authenticity (beliefs, fears, experiences, etc.) do you struggle against?
Answering these questions lets you know if you’re being honest enough with yourself to take 
this journey. It also tells you where your growth is going to be most important and most challenging through this process.
Take some time to reﬂect and write out your answers. Then, if you’re feeling bold and really 
want to ensure accountability, post it on social media or text your thoughts to a friend or mentor. Keep in mind, a shared commitment becomes a strong commitment.
Once you’ve taken that ﬁrst step, it’s time to dive in. Get ready, get set, grow.

Content: Your plan is going to be personaliz ed and it’s 
going to involve one ar
ea of choice and one area 
of skill. Just follow along with this PDF 
worksheet and you’ll end these 30 days with 
your own personalized growth plan, as you rely 
on my teaching from The 15 Laws of Growth to 
help spur your thinking. Let’s get started.Over the next 30 days, we’re going  to develop our growth 
plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, 
Ambition, 
Advancement.
These are better expressed in three questions:
• Where am I?
• Where am I going?• How will I get there?
PASSION
Early in my career, I met a mento r who provided me with a personal growth kit—an all-in-
one guide to ﬁve areas of my life. I had never invested in myself in this way, and I soon 
realized that growth is the only guarantee that tomorrow would be better than today. 
So, it’s best to have a plan for strategic growth.
Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, a reas of choice are more 
like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, conﬁdence,  faith, and trust. Areas of 
skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, ﬁtness, diet, 
professional development, etc.
Your friend,

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this 
can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and 
weaknesses.
BONUS:
John’s podcast on identifying leadership blind spots oﬀers bonus insights into seeing yourself 
realistically. Download the PDF notes and listen here: https://johnmaxwellleadershippodcast.com/episodes/leadership-blind-spots
No one can produce great things who is not thoroughly sincere in dealing with him- or herself.”Day 4-6
Questions for Group Discussion:
What strengths and weaknesses did you discover in yourself?
In thinking of your team’s strengths and weaknesses, what do you think your team would write?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What strengths and weaknesses in yourself can you recognize? What are your team’s strengths 
and weaknesses?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 10The Law of the Environment:
Growth thrives in conducive surroundings.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Environment” then come back to your worksheet.
Growth is signiﬁcantly diminished in unhealthy environments. In the video, John quotes the advice of his 
mentor and friend, Elmer Towns, who told John to spend time with great people, read great books, visit great places, attend great events, and nourish yourself. Sounds simple, but we often complicate matters. 
Here’s the truth: If we don’t invest in ourselves ﬁrst, no one else is going to. We don’t want to be cranky 
and bitter. We want to be the leader who brings life to the team, who comes with a healthy perspective, fresh eyes, a sense of wonder and amazement at what the world has to oﬀer. That means making time to create a growth environment that will help us be the best we can be.Day 24-26
Questions for Group Discussion:
Would you say you create a growth environment for your team? If so, what do you do 
to create one? If not, what can you do to create one?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
Who do you know who helps you grow?
What books in your areas of skill and choice do you need to read?
What changes do you need to make in your routine to nourish and refresh yourself?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 6The Law of Curiosity:
Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. 
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet.
Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. 
Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. 
Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your 
history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.
BONUS:
Writer and scientist Carol S. Dweck in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success writes that 
ﬁxed mindsets believe a person’s qualities are set traits and not capable of being changed. Growth mindsets believe learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. Explore which mindset you embrace and think through your culture, upbringing, and experiences brought you to that mindset.Day 11-13
Questions for Group Discussion:
Which kind of person are you: the one who asks Why or the one who asks Why Not? Give 
context to your answer
 What kinds of things do you do to fuel your curiosity or feed your interests?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What are you curious about? Have you done much to investigate those subjects?
Why or why not? Who on your team is naturally curious? How can you tell? What can you 
learn from them?

Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Intentionality” then come back to your worksheet.
As John said in the video, growth is not automatic. 
Nature suggests that growth just happens. 
But that’s not the truth. 
Change is automatic. 
Change happens whether you like it or not, but growth is guided change. 
Growth requires planning, strategy, and focused eﬀort. Growth is intentional. As a leader, you must ﬁrst 
invest in yourself because you can’t give what you don’t have.
Growth is the only 
guarantee that 
tomorrow is going 
to get better.”Day 1-3
Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
How many choices in your day are intentional? Of those, how many are choices 
in the moment and how many are the result of a strategy?
Questions for Group Discussion:
In your opinion, why do people get change and growth confused?
Of the choices you make with your team, how many are made in the moment and 
how many are based on strategy?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 9The Law of the Consistency:
Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Consistency” then come back to your worksheet.
Consistency sounds boring. But as John talked about in the Law of Expansion, routine only becomes 
boring when it’s measured against a ﬁnish line. When we understand that daily habits compound into excellence, it reframes our way of thinking. 
One of John’s most helpful strategies in this area is the Rule of 5. For example, John doesn’t crank out 
more than 100 books by just writing when he feels like it. Every day he does ﬁve things to stay consistent in his writing: reads, thinks, writes, ﬁles, and asks questions. Consistency is achieved when we can develop the necessary habits that will point us towards success, and habits are developed best when they are strategic and simple. A daily Rule of 5 for yourself and your team are essential for growth.Day 21-23
Questions for Group Discussion:
In what areas does your team struggle the most with consistency or do best with 
being consistent? As a leader, why do you think they struggle in one area and 
succeed in the other?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
In what areas of your life are you most consistent or inconsistent? Why?

How we see ourselves determines how we invest in ourselves.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of the Mirror” then co me back to your worksheet.
How do you see yourself? John often ta lks about our lives as  a story—we’re living out a st ory for others 
to read. If you don’t see yourself as  the hero of your own st ory, you  don’t have a high-enough 
self-image. You determine what  cou rse your life will take. Yo u decide what dreams you will ch ase, wh at 
impact you will make, and what  legacy you will leave. 
The Law of Mirror is the perfect time a ccept and embrace the tr uth that you are worthy of 
investment, and that your leader ship lives or dies on the inve stment s you make in yourself. In  the 
video, John said, “You have to bet on yo urself ﬁrst.” This is where we all must decide whether we’re 
willing to make that bet. Are y ou all-in?Day 7-10

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 11The Law of the Design:
To maximize growth, develop strategies.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Design” then come back to your worksheet.
We’ve ﬁnally arrived at the Law of Design, which is all about the strategies we develop to help us achieve 
our personal growth. The ﬁnal step in developing your personal growth plan will be ﬁlling out the two Growth Plan Outlines that we’ve provided—one for you and one if you’re doing this exercise with a team.
But the real work begins after today. You have to execute on the plan you’ve developed, otherwise all of 
this work will be for nothing. This is where you have to determine again that you will pay the price to grow.
We’re in this together. As you’re ﬁlling out these sheets, share them with a friend or mentor, 
communicate your observations about your plan, and ask them where they see room to reﬁne it. John says that the key to making any growth plan stick is making it public, and after 30 days, you’ll not only have a solid plan, but a community of support along the way.Day 27-30

Growth always increases your capacity.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Expansion” then come back to your worksheet.
Several years ago, Nike released one of their most famous commercials. Simple and sparse, the 
commercial features nothing but a runner, images of famous athletes projected onto buildings as the runner passes by, a haunting piano score, and Nike’s most famous (at the time) tagline: “There is no ﬁnish line.”
As John discussed in the video clip, ﬁnish line mentality takes a short-term view on the process of 
growth; people with a ﬁnish line mentality want to grow right now.
Great leaders embrace a journey mentality. They understand that the process is the product—that what 
you put into something shows up in the result. We have to lean out of our comfort zone and lean into the challenges that will stretch us towards the person and lead we want to become.Day 17-20
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where is one place you’ve developed a ﬁnish line mentality with your team?
Why do you think that is, and what can you do to inspire fresh growth?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
Where have you developed a ﬁnish line mentality and need to shake things up? 
What is your biggest life dream?
How will you know when you’re achieved that dream?

Content: 15 Rules of Vibe Coding

1. **Start from a template:** Begin your project by cloning a template from GitHub or another source to provide a solid foundation. (On cursor, Start from Repo, and paste this link to build a nextjs app that is prebuilt with AI features, database and authorization https://github.com/ansh/template-2)

2. **Use agent mode:** Utilize Cursor’s agent mode (not normal mode) to create, edit, and manage files through natural language commands.

3. **Use Perplexity:** Use perplexity to find new designs and api’s from the web. Say that you are creating a nextjs project, and that you want to create ___x___ feature, and to give you instructions AND code examples.

4. **Create new chats in Composer:** Open a new Composer chat for each distinct task. Keep agent chats short.

5. **Run locally, test frequently:** Use built-in servers to run your app locally and test often to catch issues early.

6. **Iterate and refine:** Embrace rapid iteration—don’t worry about perfect designs initially; improve them step by step.

7. **Utilize voice-to-text:** Use tools like *Whispr Flow* for faster input, and just vibe.

8. **Clone and fork wisely:** Use GitHub repos as starting templates to accelerate development, or to find inspiration, then customize them to fit your vision.

9. **Copy errors and paste into Composer agent:** When errors occur, copy error messages from your console and paste them into the Composer agent, and more times than not, it will be fixed. When dealing with errors, over explain the issue if it’s not fixed the first time.

10. **Don’t forget you can restore previous Composer chats:** Save your work frequently so you can revert to an earlier state if needed.

I need you to analyze the provided context and extract the most relevant material for developing a lesson plan for the Wolff Center for Entrepreneurship (WCE) at the University of Houston's C. T. Bauer College of Business.

The WCE is guided by a philosophy centered on empowering students to understand their values, articulate their dreams, and achieve tangible outcomes. The program emphasizes both academic rigor and real-world application, preparing students to assume leadership roles in business by teaching them how to develop and implement their own ventures. WCE fosters personal and professional growth through mentorship, experiential learning, and a commitment to integrity and innovation.

Our program focuses on four core value categories, each with four specific behavioral competencies:

1. ACTION
   - Results
   - Execution
   - Fearless Presenter
   - Seize Opportunities

2. RELATIONSHIPS
   - Connection
   - Leadership
   - Collaboration
   - Awareness

3. DISCIPLINE
   - Planning
   - Constructive Thinking
   - Organize
   - Control

4. PURPOSE
   - Authenticity
   - CEO Perspective
   - Vision
   - Growth Mindset

For the behavioral competency: We want to develop a lesson plan on 'Authenticity' for our WCE students. Please extract the relevant material and provide suggestions that align with this behavioral competency under the PURPOSE core value.

Please extract 8-10 relevant sections from the context, provide precise references for each, and suggest how to incorporate them into our entrepreneurship-focused lesson plan. Each suggestion should specifically reinforce the behavioral competency while aligning with WCE's overall philosophy. Conclude with an overall approach for teaching this competency.

In the reference output, please explicitly mention the filename from the content. It is listed in the metadata at the top of each file as "filename".

The additional user and assistant prompts are only for reference. Do not use them in your response. Please only use use the context provided. Do not assume the lesson plan the user is asking for, allow them to tell you.

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 7The Law of the Modeling:
It’s hard to improve when you have no one else but yourself to follow.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.
Chances are you might start your wish list of mentoring qualities with things like talent, success, 
achievement, reputation. While those are good things to have in a mentor, it’s far better to have moral authority. That means being a person of character, conviction, and integrity—and sustaining that life over time. You don’t have the be the world’s greatest all-around human in order to have moral authority. You can distinguish yourself in any number of areas while still growing yourself in others.Day 14-16
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where in your life do you want to develop moral authority? Why?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
If you could be known for one thing, what would you want it to be? What would it 
take to get that level of respect? What value could you pass on as a mentor? Do you 
know anyone who might want to learn from you? Who on your team has moral 
authority with you? What makes you trust them in this way?

Content: Welcome to John C. Maxwell’s 30-Day  Growth Plan! We’re glad you’re he re, and we’re looking 
forward to walking beside you o n your leadership journey. 
You downloaded this guide because y ou know something a lot of peo ple with great potential 
miss, every leader needs to embrac e per sonal growth in order to creat e growth in their 
business, team, community, or wit h an ything outside of themsel eves .
Everything you want out of life  will come through your willingn ess to grow. That’s because  you 
can’t give what you don’t have , and you can’t lead where you don’t  go.
Each section will be an exploratio n of a diﬀerent facet of growth,  complete with deep dives  into 
pressing topics, reﬂection time, a nd growth-oriented work.
The next 30 days will transform  your  approach to your daily lif e if you take this plan ser iously. 
Be intentional and you’ll see inc redible results.
This guide is designed for you  to take t his personal growth jo urney alone OR with a friend or 
group. It’s up to you. There are reﬂect ion and discussion guides  throughout for both personal 
and group study.
Let’s dive right in with two key two ques tions you need to consider:
• What keeps you from being authentic with others?
• What barriers to authenticity (beliefs, fears, experiences, etc.) do you struggle against?
Answering these questions lets you know if you’re being honest enough with yourself to take 
this journey. It also tells you where your growth is going to be most important and most challenging through this process.
Take some time to reﬂect and write out your answers. Then, if you’re feeling bold and really 
want to ensure accountability, post it on social media or text your thoughts to a friend or mentor. Keep in mind, a shared commitment becomes a strong commitment.
Once you’ve taken that ﬁrst step, it’s time to dive in. Get ready, get set, grow.

Content: Your plan is going to be personaliz ed and it’s 
going to involve one ar
ea of choice and one area 
of skill. Just follow along with this PDF 
worksheet and you’ll end these 30 days with 
your own personalized growth plan, as you rely 
on my teaching from The 15 Laws of Growth to 
help spur your thinking. Let’s get started.Over the next 30 days, we’re going  to develop our growth 
plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, 
Ambition, 
Advancement.
These are better expressed in three questions:
• Where am I?
• Where am I going?• How will I get there?
PASSION
Early in my career, I met a mento r who provided me with a personal growth kit—an all-in-
one guide to ﬁve areas of my life. I had never invested in myself in this way, and I soon 
realized that growth is the only guarantee that tomorrow would be better than today. 
So, it’s best to have a plan for strategic growth.
Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, a reas of choice are more 
like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, conﬁdence,  faith, and trust. Areas of 
skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, ﬁtness, diet, 
professional development, etc.
Your friend,

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this 
can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and 
weaknesses.

realistically. Download the PDF notes and listen here: https://johnmaxwellleadershippodcast.com/episodes/leadership-blind-spots

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 10The Law of the Environment:
Growth thrives in conducive surroundings.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Environment” then come back to your worksheet.
Growth is signiﬁcantly diminished in unhealthy environments. In the video, John quotes the advice of his 
mentor and friend, Elmer Towns, who told John to spend time with great people, read great books, visit great places, attend great events, and nourish yourself. Sounds simple, but we often complicate matters. 
Here’s the truth: If we don’t invest in ourselves ﬁrst, no one else is going to. We don’t want to be cranky 
and bitter. We want to be the leader who brings life to the team, who comes with a healthy perspective, fresh eyes, a sense of wonder and amazement at what the world has to oﬀer. That means making time to create a growth environment that will help us be the best we can be.Day 24-26
Questions for Group Discussion:
Would you say you create a growth environment for your team? If so, what do you do 
to create one? If not, what can you do to create one?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
Who do you know who helps you grow?
What books in your areas of skill and choice do you need to read?
What changes do you need to make in your routine to nourish and refresh yourself?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 6The Law of Curiosity:
Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. 
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet.
Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. 
Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. 
Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your 
history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.
BONUS:
Writer and scientist Carol S. Dweck in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success writes that 
ﬁxed mindsets believe a person’s qualities are set traits and not capable of being changed. Growth mindsets believe learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. Explore which mindset you embrace and think through your culture, upbringing, and experiences brought you to that mindset.Day 11-13
Questions for Group Discussion:
Which kind of person are you: the one who asks Why or the one who asks Why Not? Give 
context to your answer
 What kinds of things do you do to fuel your curiosity or feed your interests?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
What are you curious about? Have you done much to investigate those subjects?
Why or why not? Who on your team is naturally curious? How can you tell? What can you 
learn from them?

Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Intentionality” then come back to your worksheet.
As John said in the video, growth is not automatic. 
Nature suggests that growth just happens. 
But that’s not the truth. 
Change is automatic. 
Change happens whether you like it or not, but growth is guided change. 
Growth requires planning, strategy, and focused eﬀort. Growth is intentional. As a leader, you must ﬁrst 
invest in yourself because you can’t give what you don’t have.
Growth is the only 
guarantee that 
tomorrow is going 
to get better.”Day 1-3
Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
How many choices in your day are intentional? Of those, how many are choices 
in the moment and how many are the result of a strategy?
Questions for Group Discussion:
In your opinion, why do people get change and growth confused?
Of the choices you make with your team, how many are made in the moment and 
how many are based on strategy?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 9The Law of the Consistency:
Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Consistency” then come back to your worksheet.
Consistency sounds boring. But as John talked about in the Law of Expansion, routine only becomes 
boring when it’s measured against a ﬁnish line. When we understand that daily habits compound into excellence, it reframes our way of thinking. 
One of John’s most helpful strategies in this area is the Rule of 5. For example, John doesn’t crank out 
more than 100 books by just writing when he feels like it. Every day he does ﬁve things to stay consistent in his writing: reads, thinks, writes, ﬁles, and asks questions. Consistency is achieved when we can develop the necessary habits that will point us towards success, and habits are developed best when they are strategic and simple. A daily Rule of 5 for yourself and your team are essential for growth.Day 21-23
Questions for Group Discussion:
In what areas does your team struggle the most with consistency or do best with 
being consistent? As a leader, why do you think they struggle in one area and 
succeed in the other?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
In what areas of your life are you most consistent or inconsistent? Why?

How we see ourselves determines how we invest in ourselves.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of the Mirror” then co me back to your worksheet.
How do you see yourself? John often ta lks about our lives as  a story—we’re living out a st ory for others 
to read. If you don’t see yourself as  the hero of your own st ory, you  don’t have a high-enough 
self-image. You determine what  cou rse your life will take. Yo u decide what dreams you will ch ase, wh at 
impact you will make, and what  legacy you will leave. 
The Law of Mirror is the perfect time a ccept and embrace the tr uth that you are worthy of 
investment, and that your leader ship lives or dies on the inve stment s you make in yourself. In  the

willing to make that bet. Are y ou all-in?Day 7-10

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 11The Law of the Design:
To maximize growth, develop strategies.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Design” then come back to your worksheet.
We’ve ﬁnally arrived at the Law of Design, which is all about the strategies we develop to help us achieve 
our personal growth. The ﬁnal step in developing your personal growth plan will be ﬁlling out the two Growth Plan Outlines that we’ve provided—one for you and one if you’re doing this exercise with a team.
But the real work begins after today. You have to execute on the plan you’ve developed, otherwise all of 
this work will be for nothing. This is where you have to determine again that you will pay the price to grow.
We’re in this together. As you’re ﬁlling out these sheets, share them with a friend or mentor, 
communicate your observations about your plan, and ask them where they see room to reﬁne it. John says that the key to making any growth plan stick is making it public, and after 30 days, you’ll not only have a solid plan, but a community of support along the way.Day 27-30

Growth always increases your capacity.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Expansion” then come back to your worksheet.
Several years ago, Nike released one of their most famous commercials. Simple and sparse, the 
commercial features nothing but a runner, images of famous athletes projected onto buildings as the runner passes by, a haunting piano score, and Nike’s most famous (at the time) tagline: “There is no ﬁnish line.”
As John discussed in the video clip, ﬁnish line mentality takes a short-term view on the process of 
growth; people with a ﬁnish line mentality want to grow right now.
Great leaders embrace a journey mentality. They understand that the process is the product—that what 
you put into something shows up in the result. We have to lean out of our comfort zone and lean into the challenges that will stretch us towards the person and lead we want to become.Day 17-20
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where is one place you’ve developed a ﬁnish line mentality with your team?
Why do you think that is, and what can you do to inspire fresh growth?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
Where have you developed a ﬁnish line mentality and need to shake things up?

Content: 15 Rules of Vibe Coding

1. **Start from a template:** Begin your project by cloning a template from GitHub or another source to provide a solid foundation. (On cursor, Start from Repo, and paste this link to build a nextjs app that is prebuilt with AI features, database and authorization https://github.com/ansh/template-2)

2. **Use agent mode:** Utilize Cursor’s agent mode (not normal mode) to create, edit, and manage files through natural language commands.

3. **Use Perplexity:** Use perplexity to find new designs and api’s from the web. Say that you are creating a nextjs project, and that you want to create ___x___ feature, and to give you instructions AND code examples.

4. **Create new chats in Composer:** Open a new Composer chat for each distinct task. Keep agent chats short.

5. **Run locally, test frequently:** Use built-in servers to run your app locally and test often to catch issues early.

6. **Iterate and refine:** Embrace rapid iteration—don’t worry about perfect designs initially; improve them step by step.

7. **Utilize voice-to-text:** Use tools like *Whispr Flow* for faster input, and just vibe.

8. **Clone and fork wisely:** Use GitHub repos as starting templates to accelerate development, or to find inspiration, then customize them to fit your vision.

9. **Copy errors and paste into Composer agent:** When errors occur, copy error messages from your console and paste them into the Composer agent, and more times than not, it will be fixed. When dealing with errors, over explain the issue if it’s not fixed the first time.

10. **Don’t forget you can restore previous Composer chats:** Save your work frequently so you can revert to an earlier state if needed.

11. **Secure your secrets:** Always store API keys and sensitive data in environment files rather than hard-coding them.

12. **Commit often:** Push your progress to GitHub regularly to track changes and safeguard your work. Cursor can do this for you, just ask the agent.

13. **Deploy early:** Use platforms like Vercel to deploy your app early, to make sure there are no errors on deployment.

14. **Keep a record of the prompts that work best; reuse them often:** Document your most effective prompts to make future development and debugging easier.

15. **Enjoy the process—just vibe:** Embrace the creative journey of vibe coding, experiment, learn, and have fun along the way. just vibe.

The lesson should begin by addressing the psychological barriers many entrepreneurs face when presenting their ventures, framing fear as a natural response that can be channeled productively. I suggest implementing a 'presentation laboratory' format where students regularly present in increasingly challenging scenarios—from informal peer sessions to formal investor panels with real-world entrepreneurs. Throughout this progression, focus on three pillars: (1) authentic message development that aligns with the student's personal values, (2) strategic presentation design that emphasizes story over slides, and (3) embodied communication techniques that build physical confidence. The most effective approach would culminate in a high-stakes presentation opportunity where students must respond to unexpected challenges or questions, reinforcing WCE's action-oriented philosophy. Consider recording presentations at various stages of development so students can witness their own growth, reinforcing the Growth Mindset competency from the Purpose category while building their confidence as Fearless Presenters."

Begin with a session exploring the distinction between management (doing things right) and leadership (doing the right things), using case studies that illustrate how CEO Perspective manifests in entrepreneurial decision-making. The heart of the lesson should utilize a comprehensive business simulation where students rotate through the CEO role, facing escalating challenges that require them to balance competing priorities, make decisions with incomplete information, and communicate their reasoning to various stakeholders. Critical to this approach is structured reflection after each simulation round, where students articulate how their decisions align with both immediate business needs and longer-term vision. Throughout the lesson, deliberately connect CEO Perspective to the other PURPOSE competencies, particularly Vision and Authenticity, showing how effective CEOs maintain alignment between personal values, company mission, and strategic decisions. Consider partnering with the WCE mentorship network to arrange shadow opportunities where students observe real CEOs navigating complex decisions, followed by debrief conversations about the thought processes witnessed. The assessment should evaluate students not on the specific decisions made, but on their ability to articulate comprehensive reasoning that demonstrates holistic understanding of their venture's ecosystem."

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 7The Law of the Modeling:
It’s hard to improve when you have no one else but yourself to follow.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Modeling” then come back to your worksheet.
It’s easier to grow when you have an example to follow. But as a leader, the bigger question isn’t whose 
example will you follow; it’s what kind of example will you set? Even if you haven’t found a mentor, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a mentor. In fact, one of the best ways to really understand what to look for in a mentor is to become one yourself.
Chances are you might start your wish list of mentoring qualities with things like talent, success, 
achievement, reputation. While those are good things to have in a mentor, it’s far better to have moral authority. That means being a person of character, conviction, and integrity—and sustaining that life over time. You don’t have the be the world’s greatest all-around human in order to have moral authority. You can distinguish yourself in any number of areas while still growing yourself in others.Day 14-16
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where in your life do you want to develop moral authority? Why?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
If you could be known for one thing, what would you want it to be? What would it 
take to get that level of respect? What value could you pass on as a mentor? Do you 
know anyone who might want to learn from you? Who on your team has moral 
authority with you? What makes you trust them in this way?

Content: Welcome to John C. Maxwell’s 30-Day  Growth Plan! We’re glad you’re he re, and we’re looking 
forward to walking beside you o n your leadership journey. 
You downloaded this guide because y ou know something a lot of peo ple with great potential 
miss, every leader needs to embrac e per sonal growth in order to creat e growth in their 
business, team, community, or wit h an ything outside of themsel eves .
Everything you want out of life  will come through your willingn ess to grow. That’s because  you 
can’t give what you don’t have , and you can’t lead where you don’t  go.
Each section will be an exploratio n of a diﬀerent facet of growth,  complete with deep dives  into 
pressing topics, reﬂection time, a nd growth-oriented work.
The next 30 days will transform  your  approach to your daily lif e if you take this plan ser iously. 
Be intentional and you’ll see inc redible results.
This guide is designed for you  to take t his personal growth jo urney alone OR with a friend or 
group. It’s up to you. There are reﬂect ion and discussion guides  throughout for both personal 
and group study.
Let’s dive right in with two key two ques tions you need to consider:
• What keeps you from being authentic with others?
• What barriers to authenticity (beliefs, fears, experiences, etc.) do you struggle against?
Answering these questions lets you know if you’re being honest enough with yourself to take 
this journey. It also tells you where your growth is going to be most important and most challenging through this process.
Take some time to reﬂect and write out your answers. Then, if you’re feeling bold and really 
want to ensure accountability, post it on social media or text your thoughts to a friend or mentor. Keep in mind, a shared commitment becomes a strong commitment.
Once you’ve taken that ﬁrst step, it’s time to dive in. Get ready, get set, grow.

going to involve one ar
ea of choice and one area 
of skill. Just follow along with this PDF 
worksheet and you’ll end these 30 days with 
your own personalized growth plan, as you rely 
on my teaching from The 15 Laws of Growth to 
help spur your thinking. Let’s get started.Over the next 30 days, we’re going  to develop our growth 
plans together along the following three axes—Assessment, 
Ambition, 
Advancement.
These are better expressed in three questions:
• Where am I?
• Where am I going?• How will I get there?
PASSION
Early in my career, I met a mento r who provided me with a personal growth kit—an all-in-
one guide to ﬁve areas of my life. I had never invested in myself in this way, and I soon 
realized that growth is the only guarantee that tomorrow would be better than today. 
So, it’s best to have a plan for strategic growth.
Growth always comes in two areas: choice and skill. As I teach, a reas of choice are more 
like soft-skills—attitude, belief, perspective, values, conﬁdence,  faith, and trust. Areas of 
skill are more akin to hard-skills—writing, planning, strategy, coding, ﬁtness, diet, 
professional development, etc.
Your friend,

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 4The Law of Awareness:
Y ou must know yourself to grow yourself.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Awareness” then come back to your worksheet.
The Law of Awareness tells us that in order to grow, we have to establish and face reality. As leaders, this 
can be a challenge. We spend a lot of time assessing situations, and we often think we’re doing a great job assessing reality. But there are some tendencies we have that we need to honestly address. Do you walk around with:
• Rose-colored glasses - always seeing potential and not problems?
• The glass half-empty - with a pessimistic attitude?• An Atlas mentality - where you carry all the burdens without help?• A victim mentality - as if you’re powerless to eﬀect outcomes and create change?
It’s time to take stock of ourselves and our team, as we dig into the truth about our strengths and 
weaknesses.

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 10The Law of the Environment:
Growth thrives in conducive surroundings.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Environment” then come back to your worksheet.
Growth is signiﬁcantly diminished in unhealthy environments. In the video, John quotes the advice of his 
mentor and friend, Elmer Towns, who told John to spend time with great people, read great books, visit great places, attend great events, and nourish yourself. Sounds simple, but we often complicate matters. 
Here’s the truth: If we don’t invest in ourselves ﬁrst, no one else is going to. We don’t want to be cranky 
and bitter. We want to be the leader who brings life to the team, who comes with a healthy perspective, fresh eyes, a sense of wonder and amazement at what the world has to oﬀer. That means making time to create a growth environment that will help us be the best we can be.Day 24-26

to create one? If not, what can you do to create one?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 6The Law of Curiosity:
Growth is driven by wanting to learn more. 
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Curiosity” then come back to your worksheet.
Curious leaders are humble, self-aware, realistic, open, and willing to have a discussion just to learn. 
Fixed-minded leaders are the opposite of all of that. A ﬁxed-minded leader would rather not know, thank you very much, because knowing brings with it the burden of doing. 
Curiosity is the precursor to action. Leadership means embracing a growth mindset. No matter your 
history or background, it’s never too late to live a life of curiosity and growth. Your leadership journey will always have a next step as long as it’s fueled by curiosity.
BONUS:
Writer and scientist Carol S. Dweck in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success writes that 
ﬁxed mindsets believe a person’s qualities are set traits and not capable of being changed. Growth mindsets believe learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. Explore which mindset you embrace and think through your culture, upbringing, and experiences brought you to that mindset.Day 11-13
Questions for Group Discussion:
Which kind of person are you: the one who asks Why or the one who asks Why Not? Give 
context to your answer
 What kinds of things do you do to fuel your curiosity or feed your interests?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:

Why or why not? Who on your team is naturally curious? How can you tell? What can you

Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Intentionality” then come back to your worksheet.
As John said in the video, growth is not automatic. 
Nature suggests that growth just happens. 
But that’s not the truth. 
Change is automatic. 
Change happens whether you like it or not, but growth is guided change. 
Growth requires planning, strategy, and focused eﬀort. Growth is intentional. As a leader, you must ﬁrst 
invest in yourself because you can’t give what you don’t have.
Growth is the only 
guarantee that 
tomorrow is going 
to get better.”Day 1-3
Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
How many choices in your day are intentional? Of those, how many are choices 
in the moment and how many are the result of a strategy?
Questions for Group Discussion:
In your opinion, why do people get change and growth confused?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 9The Law of the Consistency:
Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Consistency” then come back to your worksheet.
Consistency sounds boring. But as John talked about in the Law of Expansion, routine only becomes 
boring when it’s measured against a ﬁnish line. When we understand that daily habits compound into excellence, it reframes our way of thinking. 
One of John’s most helpful strategies in this area is the Rule of 5. For example, John doesn’t crank out 
more than 100 books by just writing when he feels like it. Every day he does ﬁve things to stay consistent in his writing: reads, thinks, writes, ﬁles, and asks questions. Consistency is achieved when we can develop the necessary habits that will point us towards success, and habits are developed best when they are strategic and simple. A daily Rule of 5 for yourself and your team are essential for growth.Day 21-23
Questions for Group Discussion:
In what areas does your team struggle the most with consistency or do best with 
being consistent? As a leader, why do you think they struggle in one area and 
succeed in the other?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
In what areas of your life are you most consistent or inconsistent? Why?

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 11The Law of the Design:
To maximize growth, develop strategies.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Design” then come back to your worksheet.
We’ve ﬁnally arrived at the Law of Design, which is all about the strategies we develop to help us achieve 
our personal growth. The ﬁnal step in developing your personal growth plan will be ﬁlling out the two Growth Plan Outlines that we’ve provided—one for you and one if you’re doing this exercise with a team.
But the real work begins after today. You have to execute on the plan you’ve developed, otherwise all of 
this work will be for nothing. This is where you have to determine again that you will pay the price to grow.
We’re in this together. As you’re ﬁlling out these sheets, share them with a friend or mentor, 
communicate your observations about your plan, and ask them where they see room to reﬁne it. John says that the key to making any growth plan stick is making it public, and after 30 days, you’ll not only have a solid plan, but a community of support along the way.Day 27-30

Content: 30-DAY GROWTH PLAN 8The Law of the Expansion:
Growth always increases your capacity.
Watch and take notes on the video “The Law of Expansion” then come back to your worksheet.
Several years ago, Nike released one of their most famous commercials. Simple and sparse, the 
commercial features nothing but a runner, images of famous athletes projected onto buildings as the runner passes by, a haunting piano score, and Nike’s most famous (at the time) tagline: “There is no ﬁnish line.”
As John discussed in the video clip, ﬁnish line mentality takes a short-term view on the process of 
growth; people with a ﬁnish line mentality want to grow right now.
Great leaders embrace a journey mentality. They understand that the process is the product—that what 
you put into something shows up in the result. We have to lean out of our comfort zone and lean into the challenges that will stretch us towards the person and lead we want to become.Day 17-20
Questions for Group Discussion:
Where is one place you’ve developed a ﬁnish line mentality with your team?
Why do you think that is, and what can you do to inspire fresh growth?Questions for Journal Reﬂection:
Where have you developed a ﬁnish line mentality and need to shake things up? 
What is your biggest life dream?
How will you know when you’re achieved that dream?

Content: 15 Rules of Vibe Coding

1. **Start from a template:** Begin your project by cloning a template from GitHub or another source to provide a solid foundation. (On cursor, Start from Repo, and paste this link to build a nextjs app that is prebuilt with AI features, database and authorization https://github.com/ansh/template-2)

2. **Use agent mode:** Utilize Cursor’s agent mode (not normal mode) to create, edit, and manage files through natural language commands.

3. **Use Perplexity:** Use perplexity to find new designs and api’s from the web. Say that you are creating a nextjs project, and that you want to create ___x___ feature, and to give you instructions AND code examples.

4. **Create new chats in Composer:** Open a new Composer chat for each distinct task. Keep agent chats short.

5. **Run locally, test frequently:** Use built-in servers to run your app locally and test often to catch issues early.

6. **Iterate and refine:** Embrace rapid iteration—don’t worry about perfect designs initially; improve them step by step.

7. **Utilize voice-to-text:** Use tools like *Whispr Flow* for faster input, and just vibe.

8. **Clone and fork wisely:** Use GitHub repos as starting templates to accelerate development, or to find inspiration, then customize them to fit your vision.

9. **Copy errors and paste into Composer agent:** When errors occur, copy error messages from your console and paste them into the Composer agent, and more times than not, it will be fixed. When dealing with errors, over explain the issue if it’s not fixed the first time.

10. **Don’t forget you can restore previous Composer chats:** Save your work frequently so you can revert to an earlier state if needed.

11. **Secure your secrets:** Always store API keys and sensitive data in environment files rather than hard-coding them.

12. **Commit often:** Push your progress to GitHub regularly to track changes and safeguard your work. Cursor can do this for you, just ask the agent.

13. **Deploy early:** Use platforms like Vercel to deploy your app early, to make sure there are no errors on deployment.

14. **Keep a record of the prompts that work best; reuse them often:** Document your most effective prompts to make future development and debugging easier.

15. **Enjoy the process—just vibe:** Embrace the creative journey of vibe coding, experiment, learn, and have fun along the way. just vibe.
